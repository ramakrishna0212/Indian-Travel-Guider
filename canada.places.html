        <a><h3>The sawtooth, white-topped mountains straddling the British Columbia Alberta border inspire both awe and action.
            Five national parks Banff, Yoho, Kootenay, Waterton Lakes and Jasper offer countless opportunities to delve into the
            lush wilderness, with ribbons of hiking trails,rushing white-water and powdery ski slopes to satisfy travelers looking 
            for mountain thrills. This is one of the best places to visit in Canada in winter, but there is outdoor adventure aplenty
            during the summer months too.</h3></a>

        <a><h3>In Vancouver, sea-to-sky beauty surrounds the laid-back, cocktail-loving metropolis. With skiable mountains on the 
            outskirts, beaches fringing the coast and Stanley Park's thick rainforest just steps from downtown's sparkling skyscrapers, 
            you'll fine a harmonic convergence of city and nature.For the best of both worlds, pick up provisions and a cold beer and 
            picnic at one of the amazing city parks (during the summer months drinking alcohol is legal at most city parks).</h3></a>

        <a><h3>The largest freshwater island in the world, floating right in Lake Huron's midst, Manitoulin is a slowpoke place of 
            beaches and summery cottages. Jagged expanses of white quartzite and granite outcroppings edge the shoreline and lead to 
            shimmering vistas. First Nations culture pervades, and the island's eight communities collaborate to offer local foods
             (wild rice, corn soup) and eco-adventures (canoeing, horseback riding, hiking). Powwows add drumming, dancing and 
             storytelling to the mix for cultural-immersive experiences that connect you with the people and the land of the country
              that we now know as Canada.</h3></a>

        <a><h3>Picture-postcard Victoria is the heart of Vancouver Island, beating with bohemian shops, wood-floored coffee bars and an
            English past steeped in tea culture since the 1840s. British Columbia's capital city is full of charm, but it's only 
            the kick-off point to an island that has a bounty of natural wonders to explore. Brooding Pacific Rim National Park Reserve 
            includes the West Coast Trail, where the wind-bashed ocean meets a mist-shrouded wilderness, and surfers line up for
            Tofino's waves. With so many outdoor adventures to try, this is one of the best places in Canada for nature lovers.</h3></a>

        <a><h3>This alpine village and 2010 Winter Olympics venue is one of the world's largest, best-equipped and most popular ski
            resorts, and it’s only a 90-minute drive from downtown Vancouver. Featuring over 200 marked runs winding down two towering              mountains Whistler and Blackcomb this destination is paradise for skiers of all levels.
            Skiing may be Whistler's raison d'être, but summer visitors with their downhill mountain bikes and stand-up paddleboards 
            outnumber their ski-season equivalents, making the resort a year-round hot spot for locals and visitors alike.</h3></a>
